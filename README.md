# bash_utils
This is my little Chaos, some times you need to perform a particular task once and again,therefore, as a computer science, you write an (amall) script which help you to make it easier or at least more effectively. This repository contains all those bash scripts that help to performed some tasks on the system, which can be interesting in one or another moment.

1. **screencasting**, this script helps to record the desktop and the audio to produce videos. It also helps to stop the recording.
2. **webcam**, this script generates an small window in the bottom-right corner with the content of the webcam. 
3. **ide_tmux**, prepares the layout of the tmux with vim for development according to a personal preference
4. **compiler**, adapted version from *Luke Smith's* repository, it allows to give main commons format and compile them with the default options.
5. **extract**, same as **compiler**, it help to extract any comprossed file from main types while it deploys the result on a folder with the same name as the compressed file
6. **k2_battery**, this script is used to get the battery life of a bluetooth keyboard (keychron K2)
7. **vpn**, this script allows to open and close a connection to a VPN in combination with secret-tool and openconnect
